# Langevin_Dynamics
Langevin Dynamics for a system of beads connected with harmonic springs (Educational purpose)
Harmonic bond force is defined in force_field.py. Can be extended to include more/different forces.
Langevin Equation is integrated according to BAOAB scheme defined in Langevin_integrator.py
ANM.pdb is a dummy pdb for a 4 bead toy system.
*_run.py/*_run.ipynb: Python script/jupyter-notebook to perform the Langevin dynamics
